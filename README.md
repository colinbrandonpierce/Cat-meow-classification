<b>PROBLEM</b> <br>
What is your cat saying when it is home alone? This problem can be tackled with audio analysis and machine learning.
Dataset:...
<br><br>

<b>APPROACH</b> <br>
Training on the entirety of a cat meow spectrogram is too computationally intensive. An algorithm was develop to extract an approximation of the cat meow, to which training was done on the loudest frequency and the meow's length.

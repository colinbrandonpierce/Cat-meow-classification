<b>APPROACH</b>
Training on the entirety of a cat meow spectrogram is too intensive. An algorithm was develop to extract an approximation of the cat meow, to which training was done on the loudest frequency and the meow's length.
<b>RESULTS</b>
Using KNN, was able to obtain ~70% accuracy training on just two columns.
